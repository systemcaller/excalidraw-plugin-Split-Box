## Overview

**Split Box** is an Excalidraw plugin designed to enhance your diagramming experience. It allows you to easily split a rectangular box horizontally, vertically, or both to create a matrix-like structure. Perfect for creating grids, tables, flowcharts, or any layout that requires subdivided sections.

- **Key Features**:
  - Horizontal splitting: Divide a rectangle into rows.
  - Vertical splitting: Divide a rectangle into columns.
  - Matrix formation: Combine both for a grid layout.
  - Customizable divisions: Adjust the number of splits as needed.
